.Dt GETGROUPS 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getgroups
.Nd get the calling process' effective groups
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn getgroups "int gidsetlen" "gid_t *gidset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getgroups
system call retrieves the calling process' effective groups, i.e., the effective
group ID and the supplementary groups, and stores them in the
.Fa gidset
array.
The value of
.Fa gidsetlen
indicates the maximum number of entries that may be placed in
.Fa gidset .
.Pp
If the value of
.Fa gidsetlen
is large enough, the effective group ID is stored in the first slot
.Pq Va gidset[0]
and the supplementary groups in subsequent ones in strictly ascending order.
If
.Fa gidsetlen
is zero,
.Fn getgroups
returns one more than the cardinal of the calling process' supplementary groups
set and ignores argument
.Fa gidset .
.Pp
No more than
.Dv {NGROUPS_MAX}+1
values may ever be returned.
The value of
.Dv {NGROUPS_MAX}
should be obtained using
.Xr sysconf 3
to avoid hard-coding it into the executable.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, the
.Fn getgroups
system call returns one more than the cardinal of the supplementary groups set.
It always succeeds if argument
.Fa gidsetlen
is zero.
.Pp
A value of -1 indicates that an error occurred, and the error
code is stored in the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The possible errors for
.Fn getgroups
are:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Fa gidsetlen
is smaller than the number of supplementary groups plus one
.Pq but not zero .
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An invalid address was encountered while reading from the
.Fa gidset
array.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setgroups 2 ,
.Xr initgroups 3 ,
.Xr sysconf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn getgroups
system call conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 ,
returning the effective group ID along with supplementary groups.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getgroups
system call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Pp
Since
.Fx 14.3 ,
the
.Fn getgroups
system call has been reporting the supplementary groups in strictly ascending
order.
.Pp
Starting with
.Fx 15 ,
the
.Fn getgroups
system call will change semantics.
It will return only the supplementary groups, and not the effective group ID
anymore.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
On success, the group IDs reported in
.Fa gidset
are unique except that the effective group ID in the first slot may be
duplicated in another slot if it is also included in the supplementary groups.
.Pp
Starting with
.Fx 15 ,
the
.Fn getgroups
system call will stop reporting the effective group ID as the first slot of the
.Fa gidset
array.
Programs that process this slot in a specific way will need to be modified to
obtain the effective group ID through other means, such as a call to
.Xr getegid 2 .
